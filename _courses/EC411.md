### Syllabus — 5 Modules {#syllabus}
1. **Optical Fiber Foundations**  
   Step- vs graded-index fibers, modes & V-number, numerical aperture, attenuation & scattering, chromatic/waveguide/modal dispersion, bending & polarization effects.

2. **Optical Sources & Modulation**  
   LEDs vs laser diodes (threshold, slope efficiency, RIN), direct vs external modulation (MZM), IM/DD basics, chirp, extinction ratio, eye diagrams.

3. **Detectors & Receivers**  
   PIN/APD operation, quantum efficiency & responsivity, multiplication noise, receiver noise models (shot/thermal), TIAs, receiver sensitivity & BER (OOK).

4. **Components & Optical Amplifiers**  
   Couplers/splitters, isolators, circulators, filters, (de)multiplexers; EDFAs, Raman, SOAs—gain, saturation, noise figure, OSNR budgeting.

5. **System Design & Networks**  
   Link budget & power penalties, dispersion/PMD management, WDM/DWDM, basics of coherent detection (LO, homodyne/heterodyne), advanced formats (QPSK/QAM), ROADM/OTN overview.

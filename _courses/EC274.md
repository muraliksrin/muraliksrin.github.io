### Textbook(s) 
- Simon Haykin, *Communication Systems*
- B. P. Lathi, *Modern Analog and Digital Communication Systems*

### Lab Equipment (typical)
Function generator / AF+RF signal generator, DSO, spectrum analyzer (or SDR + GNU Radio), audio analyzer, PLL/phase detector ICs, diode/active mixers, RC/LC filters, op-amp kits, AM/FM/PM trainer boards (or discrete setups), cables/attenuators.

### Syllabus — 5 Lab Modules
1. **Signal Generation & Measurement Basics**  
   - Core experiments: sinusoid synthesis & spectra; amplitude/frequency sweep; measurement of THD, harmonics, and bandwidth on DSO/SA.  
   - Skills: time/frequency-domain measurement, windowing, averaging, calibration & dB units.

2. **Amplitude Modulation & Demodulation**  
   - Core experiments: DSB-SC with balanced modulator; DSB-LC (AM) with carrier set; SSB/VSB using filters or phasing; envelope vs synchronous detection; measure modulation index, power efficiency, distortion & spectral regrowth.  
   - Skills: carrier leakage/nulling, linearity checks, envelope detector design (RC time constant selection).

3. **Angle Modulation (FM/PM)**  
   - Core experiments: FM generation (VCO/Varactor) and PM; Carson’s rule verification; frequency discriminator & PLL demodulation; pre-emphasis/de-emphasis; measurement of deviation and SINAD.  
   - Skills: deviation calibration, PLL loop parameters, noise mitigation by emphasis networks.

4. **Receivers, Mixing & Superheterodyne Concepts**  
   - Core experiments: diode/active mixer conversion gain & image response; IF filtering; superhet blocks emulation; AGC behavior; capture effect in FM.  
   - Skills: LO planning, image-reject considerations, selectivity vs sensitivity trade-offs.

5. **Noise, SNR & Link Budgeting**  
   - Core experiments: add controlled AWGN (or baseband noise) and measure post-detection SNR for AM vs FM; figure-of-merit comparison; simple link budget with measured path loss/attenuators; sensitivity thresholding.  
   - Skills: noise figure intuition, SNR measurement, power budgeting and margins.

#### Deliverables (suggested)
- **Pre-lab**: brief design/calculation sheet.  
- **In-lab**: annotated screenshots (DSO/SA) with settings.  
- **Post-lab**: short report with results, error sources, and 1–2 paragraph reflection.

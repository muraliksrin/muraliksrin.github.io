### Textbook(s) 
- Instructor notes and standard references (e.g., Haykin / Lathi) as needed.

### Syllabus — 5 Modules 
1. **Signals & Modulation Need**  
   Baseband vs passband, spectra, channel impairments, why modulation, taxonomy of analog schemes.
2. **Amplitude Modulation**  
   DSB-SC, AM (DSB-LC), SSB, VSB; power efficiency, envelope detector, synchronous detection; superhet overview.
